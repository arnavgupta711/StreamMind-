# StreamMind

StreamMind is an advanced real-time Quality of Service (QoS) management system for live video game streaming platforms, leveraging big data analytics, deep neural networks (DNN), and BERT-based sentiment analysis. The goal is to dynamically optimize streaming quality based on real-time user sentiment, engagement, and network conditions.

## Project Overview

As platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming continue to grow, maintaining high-quality streaming with optimal user engagement becomes challenging. Traditional QoS approaches fail to adapt in real time, leading to fluctuating stream quality and inconsistent viewer experience. StreamMind addresses these issues by using deep learning techniques to classify user satisfaction and interpret sentiment for optimal real-time QoS management.

## Key Features

- **Data-driven QoS Management**: Uses big data analytics to adjust streaming quality in real-time based on network conditions and user engagement.
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**: Classifies user satisfaction and engagement for efficient stream optimization.
- **BERT-based Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes real-time viewer sentiment to make decisions about stream quality and engagement.
- **Benchmark Dataset**: Works with a benchmark dataset to simulate live streaming environments.
